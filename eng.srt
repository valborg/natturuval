00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,605
Lion: Behold

2
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:05,605
my domain

3
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:10,605
I am king of all that you see

4
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:19,605
None would dare raise 
a challenge to me

5
00:00:20,84 --> 00:00:22,605
Fly: Not so fast!

6
00:00:23,97 --> 00:00:26,605
Lion: what’s this? Who are you?

7
00:00:27,54 --> 00:00:30,605
Fly: Be prepared – I have...

8
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:33,605
Lion: WHAT?!

9
00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:34,605
Fly: MORE FEET!

10
00:00:35,93 --> 00:00:39,42
Lion: Noooooooooooo!!!!

11
00:00:39,42 --> 00:00:42,55
Fly: Truly I am the superior creature

12
00:00:43,65 --> 00:00:44,53
heh heh heh

13
00:00:45,53 --> 00:00:46,52
Mola mola: Blub

14
00:00:46,52 --> 00:00:48,88
Fly: What on earth are you?

15
00:00:48,88 --> 00:00:51,47
Mola mola: Blub blub

16
00:00:51,47 --> 00:00:57,00
Fly: you gotta be kidding meeeeee

17
00:00:57,00 --> 00:01:01,38
Mola mola: Blub

18
00:01:01,38 --> 00:01:06,89
Nature is wild and competition is all about
finding that niche where you can thrive

19
00:01:06,89 --> 00:01:09,52
But It’s not always the biggest or strongest
that survive

20
00:01:09,52 --> 00:01:13,25
The things that make you competitive 
aren’t always obvious


202
00:01:13,25 --> 00:01:16,25
and sometimes the most surprising traits win out

21
00:01:17,45 --> 00:01:18,18
Hi, I’m Justin

22
00:01:18,18 --> 00:01:19,45
And I’m Valborg

23
00:01:19,45 --> 00:01:23,03
And we’re excited to introduce you to our new game
Natturuval

24
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:25,03 
It’s Náttúruval

25
00:01:25,03 --> 00:01:27,36
Right uhm yeah that

26
00:01:27,36 --> 00:01:30,14
In Natturuval, you’ll compare animals from all over the world 


262
00:01:30,14 --> 00:01:33,14
based on their real-life information

27
00:01:33,14 --> 00:01:35,16
The game comes with over 
a hundred unique cards with

272
00:01:35,16 --> 00:01:40,16
full color photos and 
scientifically-derived statistics

28
00:01:40,16 --> 00:01:43,20 
You’ll get to learn exciting facts 
about all sort of animals

282
00:01:43,20 --> 00:01:46,20 
while playing a fun game!

29
00:01:46,20 --> 00:01:48,00
Everyone gets a set of cards, each with a different animal

292
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:51,00
and its stats in six different categories

30
00:01:51,00 --> 00:01:54,40
You roll a pair of dice to see which category 
you’re comparing on

31
00:01:54,40 --> 00:02:00,33
Every player picks the animal from their hand
that they think is best for this matchup

32
00:02:00,33 --> 00:02:06,56 
The animal with the highest (or lowest) number 
in the chosen category is the winner

33
00:02:06,56 --> 00:02:11,06 
Natturuval is aimed at kids 
from 6 to 10 years old

34
00:02:11,06 --> 00:02:14,39
but it’s a great party game for 
kids of all ages and adults alike

35
00:02:14,39 --> 00:02:18,44
For younger kids there are several 
simplified game modes

352
00:02:18,44 --> 00:02:22,44
that are fantastic fun without the complex rules

36
00:02:22,44 --> 00:02:26,45
And for the grown-ups, we have the Subjective Party version

37
00:02:26,45 --> 00:02:30,30
Using our website, you get a random category for your round

38
00:02:30,30 --> 00:02:34,25
Questions like
"Which animal would buy the most chocolate ice cream?"

39
00:02:34,25 --> 00:02:36,50
or "Which animal drives the slowest?"

40
00:02:36,50 --> 00:02:40,53
or "Which animal would make the best president?"

41
00:02:40,53 --> 00:02:44,76 
Then players pick an animal and present their case

42
00:02:44,76 --> 00:02:46,68
During the crowdfunding campaign, 
we’re going to be making available

422
00:02:46,68 --> 00:02:49,68
some things you won’t be able to get elsewhere

43
00:02:49,68 --> 00:02:52,80 
like stickers, posters, and even t-shirts

44
00:02:52,80 --> 00:02:59,00
On top of that, we’re going to make a special
bonus Fantasy Deck full of fantastical creatures, 

45
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:01,78
These cards are meant to be used with the regular game

452
00:03:01,78 --> 00:03:05,38
but these fantastic animals bring their own unique flairs

46
00:03:05,38 --> 00:03:10,58
And if you want, you can even create your own cards
for this deck using whatever animals you like

47
00:03:10,58 --> 00:03:16,33
And we’re really excited to do a physical party game,
glow in the dark dice and even more cards

48
00:03:16,33 --> 00:03:21,50
Natturuval is a great way to introduce kids
to lots of different animals, 

49
00:03:21,50 --> 00:03:25,81
and we’re committed to making this game available
to as many people as we can, 

50
00:03:26,31 --> 00:03:29,50
If you’re able, you can pledge to get not only 
your copy of Natturuval

51
00:03:30,30 --> 00:03:33,10
but also have a copy donated to
a school, community center,

512
00:03:33,10 --> 00:03:37,10
or other educational group
that we’ll be partnering with

52
00:03:37,40 --> 00:03:40,25
We’re also going to be printing this game
in both English and Icelandic!

53
00:03:40,65 --> 00:03:41,75
Thank you for watching

54
00:03:41,75 --> 00:03:46,00
and thank you for helping us bring Natturuval to life

55
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:48,00
